Project Description (Bus Ticket Booking System using Java File Handling)

The Bus Ticket Booking System is a console-based Java application developed to demonstrate the use of file handling concepts such as reading, writing, and modifying text files. This project simulates a basic ticket booking system where users can book bus tickets, view booked tickets, and cancel existing tickets. All ticket information is stored persistently in a text file, ensuring data is retained even after the program terminates.

The system provides a simple menu-driven interface that allows users to interact easily with the application. When a user books a ticket, passenger details such as passenger name, bus number, and seat number are collected and stored in a text file (tickets.txt) using file writing operations. This ensures that ticket records are saved permanently.

The view tickets feature reads data from the text file using file reading operations and displays all booked tickets in a readable format. This helps users verify booking details without accessing the file manually.

The cancel ticket functionality demonstrates file modification. Since direct deletion of a specific record from a file is not possible, the program copies all records except the cancelled ticket into a temporary file and replaces the original file. This approach effectively removes the selected ticket from the system.

This project helps learners understand real-time usage of Java file handling classes such as FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter. It also improves logical thinking by implementing conditions, loops, exception handling, and string manipulation. Overall, this project is suitable for beginners and students learning Java I/O operations and basic application development.

Tools Used in the Project
1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Visual Studio Code is used as the code editor for developing the project. It provides a user-friendly interface, syntax highlighting, error detection, and extensions for Java development. VS Code makes writing, editing, and debugging Java programs efficient and organized.

2. Java Development Kit (JDK)

The JDK is essential for compiling and running Java programs. It includes the Java compiler (javac) and Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which convert Java source code into bytecode and execute it. The project uses core Java features such as file handling, exception handling, and utility classes provided by the JDK.

3. GitHub

GitHub is used for version control and project storage. It allows developers to store their project code online, track changes, and share the project with others. Using GitHub improves collaboration and helps maintain different versions of the project safely.
